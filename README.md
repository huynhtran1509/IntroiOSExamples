# IntroiOSExamples
A group of examples that are used for the WillowTree Intro to iOS Course

## Hello World
The most basic of basic introductions into iOS. Create your first app and know that you are on your way to becoming an iOS developer!

## Camera Example
In this example we use the iOS camera and photo library to display an image on the screen. Note that for using the camera you must run the app on a device since the simulator does not have that capability.

## Custom Table Cells
Want to create a `UITableView` with custom designed table cells. Use this example project to see how to create a custom `nib` file and use that in creating a beautifully designed table view. 

## Local Push Notifications
Explore some of the possibilities with iOS push notifications. In this example we use the new iOS 10 notifications library and demonstrate how to present notifications to the user. We also include an example of allowing the notification to occur while the app is open.

## Map Kit Example
Learn how to use the iOS `MapKit` and present an annotation on the view. Also in this example is how to manipulate the map to go to certain coordinates and zoom levels. 

## Modal Presentation
Not all screens should be in the same `UIViewController`. Use this example to learn how to present other views on the screen and navigate the user through your app.

## REST API
With most apps eventually you will need to integrate with an API of some sort. For this example learn how to use `Alamofire` with swift and integrate with the Pokemon api!

# Labs for the Course

## Lab 1
If you missed implementing the first lab in the course, this is the result of our hard work. A fully functioning app that displays Hello World on the main screen.

## Lab 2
This is the complete version of the `UITableView` implementation for the second lab. We use swift arrays to populate the table with our strings.
